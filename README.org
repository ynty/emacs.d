* My Emacs Config

** Principles

1. LSP First
2. Not Using Evil
3. Use straight.el to Manage Package

** How to Use

To use this config, you need to clone the repository to your init file directory 
(e.g. ~/.emacs.d/, etc).

Then you need to put all of your org-agenda files into ../org/ of your 
init file directory.
